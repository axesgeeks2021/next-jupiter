            interests you. It involves considering various factors that influence your
            education and career, including your academic strengths, career aspirations, and

              <p>A course that aligns with your academic strengths and interests ensures
                that you excel in your studies. It's about choosing a field that not
                only captures your passion but also capitalizes on your skills and
                abilities. Academic fit leads to better academic performance, higher
                engagement, and overall satisfaction with your education.</p>
